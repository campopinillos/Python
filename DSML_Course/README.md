# Structure of this repo
## 1) Data analysis and visualization with Python
> The objective of this module is to train in the use of the Python programming language as a tool for data analysis and visualization. The module will cover the basic elements of the language, the programming environments that support its interactive use and the specialized libraries for data analysis and visualization.
